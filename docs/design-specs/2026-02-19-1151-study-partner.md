# Study Partner Skill

**Created:** 2026-02-19 **Implementation Plan:** [link to implementation plan]

---

## Overview

**What:** A user-invoked `/study-partner` skill that facilitates deliberate learning
through interactive exercises based on learning science principles.

**Why:** AI-assisted coding can create an "AI productivity trap" where fast output hides
gaps in understanding. This skill gives users an on-demand way to study code they've
worked on or external content they want to internalize, using research-backed exercise
techniques.

**Type:** Feature

## Requirements

### Must Have

- [ ] User-invoked only — never auto-triggered or proactively offered by Claude
- [ ] Bare `/study-partner` invocation (no input) always asks the user what they want to
      study
- [ ] Repo-context mode: user references work in the repo, Claude explores
      codebase/commits with user guidance, then runs an exercise
- [ ] External content mode: user provides a URL, file path, or pasted snippet, Claude
      studies it and runs an exercise
- [ ] 5 exercise types with light selection heuristics (see Design Decisions)
- [ ] Retrieval practice used as a technique within exercises, not a standalone exercise
      type
- [ ] Pause-for-input pattern at all exercise steps — Claude waits for user response
      before continuing
- [ ] Own PRINCIPLES.md with learning science foundations (adapted from
      learning-opportunities)
- [ ] Claude selects exercise type automatically based on context

### Nice to Have

- [ ] Graceful handling of ambiguous invocations (asks clarifying questions rather than
      guessing)
- [ ] Ability to pivot exercise type mid-session if the current one isn't landing
- [ ] Dynamic difficulty adjustment (increase complexity when user is nailing it, narrow
      scope when struggling)

### Out of Scope

- Persistence or state between sessions
- Auto-triggering or proactive exercise offers
- Plugin packaging (.claude-plugin)
- Team measurement playbook (MEASURE-THIS.md)
- Session limits (no cap on exercises per session)

## Design Decisions

### 1. Invocation Model: User-Invoked Only

**Options considered:**

1. Auto-triggered by Claude during sessions (like learning-opportunities) — seamless but
   interrupts workflow, user has no control over timing
2. User-invoked only — requires explicit `/study-partner` call, user controls when to
   study

**Decision:** User-invoked only. The skill serves a different purpose than
learning-opportunities. Users should choose when to enter "study mode" rather than having
it suggested mid-flow. Bare invocations without input always prompt the user rather than
assuming intent.

### 2. Retrieval Check-in: Technique, Not Exercise Type

**Options considered:**

1. Keep as standalone exercise type (as in learning-opportunities) — doesn't fit
   user-invoked model since Claude can't proactively trigger it at session start
2. Drop entirely — loses the value of retrieval practice
3. Fold into other exercises as a technique — Claude weaves "what do you remember
   about..." prompts into exercises when it detects prior familiarity from conversation
   context

**Decision:** Option 3. Retrieval practice is a powerful learning technique but doesn't
work as a standalone exercise in a user-invoked skill. When Claude detects the user has
prior engagement with a topic (from conversation context), it can open any exercise with a
retrieval warm-up.

### 3. Exercise Selection: Light Heuristics

**Options considered:**

1. Structured rules mapping exercise types to situations — consistent but rigid, may
   override better judgment
2. No guidance, fully open selection — flexible but Claude may default to the same
   exercise repeatedly
3. Light heuristics as suggestions — nudges Claude toward good fits without boxing it in

**Decision:** Option 3. The following are suggestions, not rules:

| Exercise                              | Consider when...                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prediction → Observation → Reflection | There's runnable or traceable code. "What do you think happens when X?"                                   |
| Generation → Comparison               | User is learning a pattern or approach. "How would you solve this?" then compare to actual implementation |
| Trace the Path                        | Complex control flow, data pipelines, request lifecycles. "Walk through what happens step by step"        |
| Debug This                            | User has working understanding, needs to stress-test it. Present a plausible bug or edge case             |
| Teach It Back                         | User wants to solidify understanding. "Explain this to me like I'm new"                                   |

Claude can override these based on full context (user's words, complexity of material, how
the session is going).

### 4. Input Classification

**Options considered:**

1. Explicit mode selection (user picks "repo" or "external") — adds friction
2. Claude infers mode from input and confirms — natural flow, minimal friction

**Decision:** Option 2. Claude reads the user's input and classifies as repo-context,
external content, or ambiguous. For ambiguous cases, Claude asks what they want to study.
No explicit mode menu.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/study-partner` invoked with a repo-context prompt causes Claude to explore
      relevant code/commits before running an exercise
- [ ] `/study-partner` invoked with a URL causes Claude to fetch and study the content,
      then run an exercise
- [ ] `/study-partner` invoked with a file path causes Claude to read the file and run an
      exercise
- [ ] `/study-partner` invoked with a pasted snippet causes Claude to study it and run an
      exercise
- [ ] `/study-partner` invoked with no input prompts the user to specify what they want to
      study
- [ ] Claude selects exercise type automatically — user does not choose from a menu
- [ ] Claude pauses at all exercise steps and waits for user input before continuing
- [ ] Claude never offers or triggers the skill on its own
- [ ] Retrieval warm-ups appear naturally within exercises when prior familiarity is
      detected
- [ ] User can continue with additional exercises or end the session at any time
