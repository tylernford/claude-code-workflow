# Implementation Plan: Study Partner Skill

**Created:** 2026-02-19 **Type:** Feature **Overview:** A user-invoked `/study-partner`
skill that facilitates deliberate learning through interactive exercises based on learning
science principles. **Design Spec:** docs/design-specs/2026-02-19-1151-study-partner.md

---

## Summary

Create a `/study-partner` skill with two files: a PRINCIPLES.md adapted from
learning-opportunities and a SKILL.md that defines invocation handling, two input modes
(repo-context and external content), five exercise types with light selection heuristics,
retrieval practice as a technique woven into exercises, and pause-for-input facilitation.

---

## Codebase Verification

_Confirm assumptions from design spec match actual codebase_

- [x] Skills live under `.claude/skills/` — Verified: yes, existing skills (design, plan,
      build, document) follow this pattern
- [x] learning-opportunities exists as reference material — Verified: yes, at
      `learning-opportunities/skills/learning-opportunities/` with SKILL.md and
      resources/PRINCIPLES.md
- [x] No existing study-partner files — Verified: yes, no conflicts
- [x] SKILL.md frontmatter conventions — Verified: user-invocable skills use
      `name`/`description` frontmatter (distinct from workflow phase skills which use
      `disable-model-invocation`/`allowed-tools`)

**Patterns to leverage:**

- learning-opportunities SKILL.md: exercise types, pause-for-input pattern, techniques to
  weave in, hands-on code exploration, facilitation guidelines
- learning-opportunities PRINCIPLES.md: learning science foundations (adapt largely as-is)

**Discrepancies found:**

- None — design spec assumptions match codebase

---

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create PRINCIPLES.md

**Description:** Create the learning science foundations document, adapted from the
learning-opportunities version. Update internal references to point to study-partner's
SKILL.md instead of learning-opportunities. Keep all learning science content intact.

**Files:**

- `.claude/skills/study-partner/resources/PRINCIPLES.md` — create

**Done when:** PRINCIPLES.md exists with all learning science sections from the original,
with references updated to point to study-partner's SKILL.md.

**Commit:** "Add study-partner learning science PRINCIPLES.md"

---

### Task 2: Create SKILL.md

**Description:** Create the main skill definition with the following structure:

1. **Frontmatter** — `name: study-partner`, `description` adapted from design spec
   overview
2. **Purpose** — adapted from learning-opportunities, reframed for user-invoked model
3. **Invocation handling** — bare invocation asks what to study; input classification
   (repo-context, external content, ambiguous)
4. **Repo-context mode** — Claude explores codebase/commits with user guidance, then runs
   exercise
5. **External content mode** — Claude fetches URL / reads file / studies snippet, then
   runs exercise
6. **Exercise types** (5) — Prediction→Observation→Reflection, Generation→Comparison,
   Trace the Path, Debug This, Teach It Back. Adapted from learning-opportunities with
   light selection heuristics table from design spec
7. **Retrieval practice as technique** — guidance on weaving "what do you remember
   about..." into exercises when prior familiarity is detected from conversation context
8. **Pause-for-input pattern** — carried over from learning-opportunities
9. **Techniques to weave in** — carried over from learning-opportunities (elaborative
   interrogation, interleaving, varied practice, concrete-to-abstract, error analysis)
10. **Hands-on code exploration** — carried over from learning-opportunities (completion
    prompts, fading scaffolding, pair finding with explaining, when to show code directly)
11. **Facilitation guidelines** — adapted from learning-opportunities for user-invoked
    context (no auto-offering, no session limits, user controls pacing)

**Files:**

- `.claude/skills/study-partner/SKILL.md` — create

**Code example** (frontmatter):

```markdown
---
name: study-partner
description:
  Facilitates deliberate learning through interactive exercises based on learning science
  principles. User-invoked only — run /study-partner to start a study session on repo code
  or external content.
---
```

**Done when:** SKILL.md covers all 5 exercise types, both input modes, pause-for-input
pattern, retrieval-as-technique guidance, selection heuristics, and facilitation
guidelines. All acceptance criteria from the design spec are addressable by the skill's
instructions.

**Commit:** "Add study-partner SKILL.md"

---

### Task 3: Update design spec with implementation plan link

**Description:** Update the design spec header to replace `[link to implementation plan]`
with the actual path to this implementation plan.

**Files:**

- `docs/design-specs/2026-02-19-1151-study-partner.md` — modify

**Done when:** The `Implementation Plan:` field in the design spec header contains
`docs/implementation-plans/2026-02-19-1232-study-partner.md`.

**Commit:** "Link design spec to implementation plan"

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/study-partner` invoked with a repo-context prompt causes Claude to explore
      relevant code/commits before running an exercise
- [ ] `/study-partner` invoked with a URL causes Claude to fetch and study the content,
      then run an exercise
- [ ] `/study-partner` invoked with a file path causes Claude to read the file and run an
      exercise
- [ ] `/study-partner` invoked with a pasted snippet causes Claude to study it and run an
      exercise
- [ ] `/study-partner` invoked with no input prompts the user to specify what they want to
      study
- [ ] Claude selects exercise type automatically — user does not choose from a menu
- [ ] Claude pauses at all exercise steps and waits for user input before continuing
- [ ] Claude never offers or triggers the skill on its own
- [ ] Retrieval warm-ups appear naturally within exercises when prior familiarity is
      detected
- [ ] User can continue with additional exercises or end the session at any time

## Completion

**Completed:** [Date] **Final Status:** [Complete | Partial | Abandoned]

**Summary:** [Brief description of what was actually built]

**Deviations from Plan:** [Any significant changes from original design]

## Notes

- Sections 9-11 of Task 2 (Techniques to weave in, Hands-on code exploration, Facilitation
  guidelines) are carried over from learning-opportunities SKILL.md, adapted for the
  user-invoked context — not net-new content.
- PRINCIPLES.md (Task 1) is adapted from learning-opportunities with minimal changes
  (reference updates only).
