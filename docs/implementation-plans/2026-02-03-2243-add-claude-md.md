# Implementation Plan: Add CLAUDE.md for Workflow Context

**Design Doc:** docs/design-plans/2026-02-03-2241-add-claude-md.md
**Created:** 2026-02-03

---

## Summary

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file at the repo root that provides instant workflow context for new Claude sessions, eliminating the need to manually read files to understand the project structure.

---

## Codebase Verification

*Confirmed assumptions from design doc match actual codebase*

- [x] `.claude/commands/` exists with all 4 commands - Verified: yes
- [x] `docs/design-plans/` exists - Verified: yes
- [x] `docs/implementation-plans/` exists - Verified: yes
- [x] `docs/templates/` contains design-doc.md, implementation-plan.md - Verified: yes
- [x] `docs/changelog.md` exists - Verified: yes
- [x] `docs/workflow-ideas.md` exists - Verified: yes
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` does not exist yet - Verified: yes

**Patterns to leverage:**
- None needed - this is a new standalone file

**Discrepancies found:**
- None - all assumptions match reality

---

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create CLAUDE.md with workflow context
**Description:** Create `CLAUDE.md` at repo root with the approved content from the design doc. The content provides orientation for Claude sessions: repo purpose, directory structure, commands, and core principles.

**Files:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - create

**Code example:**
```markdown
# Claude Development Workflow

This repo contains a phase-based workflow system for building features with Claude Code. The workflow itself is built and improved using this same system.

## Structure

` ` `
.claude/commands/     # Slash command definitions
docs/
├── design-plans/     # Design documents
├── implementation-plans/  # Task breakdowns
├── templates/        # design-doc.md, implementation-plan.md
├── changelog.md      # Completed feature history
└── workflow-ideas.md # Future improvements
` ` `

## Commands

| Command | Phase | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `/design` | 1 | Transform idea into design document |
| `/plan` | 2 | Break design into executable tasks |
| `/build` | 3 | Execute tasks with commits |
| `/document` | 4 | Complete docs, generate PR draft |

## Core Principles

- **User drives** — Claude proposes, user approves. No auto-advancing.
- **One phase per session** — End session after each phase. Docs are the handoff.
- **Slash commands only** — Phase transitions require explicit `/command`.
- **Preserve the mess** — Note deviations in Build Log, don't rewrite plans.
```

**Done when:**
- `CLAUDE.md` exists at repo root
- Content matches approved draft from design doc
- File is ~30 lines or less

**Commit:** "Add CLAUDE.md for workflow context"

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` exists at repo root
- [ ] File contains all required sections (Structure, Commands, Core Principles)
- [ ] File is ~30 lines or less
- [ ] Content matches approved draft in design doc exactly

---

## Notes

This is a straightforward single-task implementation. The content is pre-approved in the design doc, so no design decisions needed during build.
