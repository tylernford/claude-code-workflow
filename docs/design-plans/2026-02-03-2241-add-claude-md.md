# Add CLAUDE.md for Workflow Context

**Created:** 2026-02-03
**Status:** Complete
**Implementation Plan Doc:** docs/implementation-plans/2026-02-03-2243-add-claude-md.md

---

## Overview

**What:** Add a `CLAUDE.md` file to the repo root that provides orientation context for Claude sessions.

**Why:** In a previous design session, Claude wasted time asking basic questions ("Where is the /build skill defined?", "Is the 4-phase workflow established?") that it could have answered by reading the codebase. Rather than requiring Claude to read all files each session, a `CLAUDE.md` provides instant context automatically.

**Type:** Enhancement

---

## Requirements

### Must Have
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` file at repo root
- [ ] Describes what this repo is (workflow system for Claude Code)
- [ ] Notes that the workflow improves itself
- [ ] Lists directory structure with brief descriptions
- [ ] Lists all 4 commands with phase numbers and purposes
- [ ] Includes all core principles

### Nice to Have
- None identified

### Out of Scope
- Changes to existing command files
- Comprehensive workflow documentation (that's what the command files are for)
- Duplicating template contents

---

## Design Decisions

### Full Documentation vs. Minimal Orientation
**Options considered:**
1. Full documentation — Complete workflow overview, all principles explained in detail
2. Minimal with pointers — Just enough to orient, details live in command files

**Decision:** Option 2. The command files already contain detailed instructions. `CLAUDE.md` provides orientation so Claude knows what exists and where to find it. This avoids duplication and maintenance burden.

### List Commands Explicitly vs. Point to Directory
**Options considered:**
1. List commands explicitly — `/design`, `/plan`, `/build`, `/document`
2. Point to directory — "Commands are in `.claude/commands/`"

**Decision:** Option 1. The four commands are stable and listing them gives immediate understanding of the workflow phases. Maintenance burden is minimal.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` exists at repo root
- [ ] File is ~30 lines or less
- [ ] New Claude sessions have workflow context without manually reading files
- [ ] Content matches the approved draft (see below)

# Claude Development Workflow

This repo contains a phase-based workflow system for building features with Claude Code. The workflow itself is built and improved using this same system.

## Structure

` ` `
.claude/commands/     # Slash command definitions

├── design-plans/     # Design documents
├── implementation-plans/  # Task breakdowns

## Commands

| Command | Phase | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `/design` | 1 | Transform idea into design document |
| `/plan` | 2 | Break design into executable tasks |
| `/build` | 3 | Execute tasks with commits |
| `/document` | 4 | Complete docs, generate PR draft |

## Core Principles

- **User drives** — Claude proposes, user approves. No auto-advancing.
- **One phase per session** — End session after each phase. Docs are the handoff.
- **Slash commands only** — Phase transitions require explicit `/command`.
- **Preserve the mess** — Note deviations in Build Log, don't rewrite plans.

## Files to Create/Modify

```
CLAUDE.md  # create - workflow context file at repo root
```

## Build Log

*Filled in during `/build` phase*

| Date | Task | Files | Notes |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| 2026-02-03 | Task 1 | CLAUDE.md | Created as planned, no deviations |

---

## Completion

**Completed:** 2026-02-03
**Final Status:** Complete

**Summary:** Created `CLAUDE.md` at repo root with workflow orientation context. The file includes the repo purpose, directory structure, command table, and core principles—all matching the approved draft exactly.

**Deviations from Plan:** None. Implementation matched the design exactly.
